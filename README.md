# alpine-monero-miner
Monero mining software in a secure alpine linux container.

The goal of this project is to quickly enable you to mine Monero without the hassle of knowing how to install or secure your mining software.
This project uses [Wolf's (OhGotAPet) cpuminer-multi](https://github.com/OhGodAPet/cpuminer-multi).

This project was going to be a collection of miners but I have decided to break them up into separate repositories.

# How to use
